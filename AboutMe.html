        <p class="showcase_text"> Hi! I’m Kacey Halstead and I specialise in games programming. Throughout my academic career, I have gravitated towards computing subjects especially and I have always enjoyed learning, no matter what subject (and still do!). This -combined with my life-long passion for gaming- has led me to where I am today, even more excited for what’s to come next.<br><br>
            I am a current student at East Norfolk Sixth Form College studying a BTEC Level 3 National Diploma in Digital Games Production and A Level Computer Science whilst having already obtained an AS level in Mathematics. Next year, I am hoping to undertake a Level 4 Foundation Diploma in Games Design and Production before continuing to university to study a BSc (Hons) in Games Programming. Due to the nature of games programming and the extensive knowledge needed for this field of work, I regularly practice using the following software/languages: <br><br>
            
            <ul class="AboutMeList">
                <li>The Unreal Engine 4 (blueprints)</li>
                <li>Unity/Visual Studio (C#)</li>
                <li>Visual Studio Code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)</li>
                <li>Python</li>
            </ul><br>

            <p class="showcase_text">Aside from being a student, I work part time as a play area supervisor, which has vastly improved my communication skills; a vital ability needed in the games industry. Furthermore, I am able to work both independently and in a team equally well, maintaining a positive and dedicated attitude whilst producing work to the best of my ability. <br><br>
